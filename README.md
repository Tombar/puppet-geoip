============

Crapy Geoip module to update DBs from maxmind using geoipupdate

Tested on Debian Wheezy, should work on any linux flavor easily

Runs geoipupdate once a week to keep DBs updated
Only notifies if error to root account

Thanks to Matthias Saou <matthias@saou.eu> https://github.com/thias/puppet-geoip from which I rip most of it.
